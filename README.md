# KernelSVM-for-Cats-and-Dogs-classification
<h3>
Solve the dog-cat classification problem from Kaggle 
1-Download the train dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data <br>
  </h3>
  <h3>
2-Use 1000 cat images and 1000 dog images for training and 100 cat images and 100 dog images for testing
2-Extract the features of the training set using HOG.

<h3>
3-Use the extracted features (fd) to train SVM on the training dataset with an appropriate kernel function. 
</h3>
<h3>4-Test the trained model and calculate the accuracy the test dataset.  </h3>
